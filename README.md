# One_Shot_Path_Planning

## One-Shot Multi-Path Planning Using Fully Convolutional Networks

- This repository contains the implementation and codebase inspired by the research article "One-Shot Multi-Path Planning Using Fully Convolutional Networks in a Comparison to Other Algorithms" published in Frontiers in Neurorobotics.
Overview

 - The objective of this repository is to provide a comprehensive guide and implementation for one-shot multi-path planning using fully convolutional networks (FCNs). This repository replicates and extends the methodologies discussed in the research paper to facilitate further development and research in this field.
